/// The census is a BCL delegate in an AppDomain data slot, so neither plugin references the other:

/// know (no snapshot yet, or a stale one). Called on the game thread; the cluster answers from a local
/// snapshot.

/// MES spawns the prefabs of an accepted spawn over the next frames, and the cluster's snapshot lags by
/// seconds, so every accepted spawn is also counted as a reservation for <see cref="ReservationTime"/>:
/// two spawns in quick succession cannot both pass a limit the first one filled.
