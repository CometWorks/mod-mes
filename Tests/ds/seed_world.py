"""Pre-seeds a world for a cluster (#1365): loads it once in a plain dedicated server with its mods, saves it, and
writes the saved world to OUT. The game creates the NPC factions the mods define at the first load of a world
that lacks them, each process with its own random ids; a cluster whose processes all load the seeded save
share one set of factions and founders.

    python3 Tests/ds/seed_world.py SRC OUT     (from the repo root)

SRC is a world folder (Sandbox.sbc, Sandbox_config.sbc, SANDBOX_0_0_0_.sbs); its mods are downloaded from the
Workshop by the server. Runs Tests/ds/run.py (test slot, RAM floor) with the probe only, no MES Cluster, and the
plan Tests/cluster/plan-seed.txt (save, wait, done). OUT must not exist. Prints the faction tags before and
after, and says so when the save holds no new faction.
